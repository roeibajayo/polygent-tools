# Example Workflow

This workflow demonstrates how to structure a Markdown-based workflow with multiple step types.

## Overview

The workflow includes:
1. A message step to provide instructions
2. A task step to execute a script
3. A clearContext step to reset the agent context

Each step is defined in a separate numbered Markdown file (1.md, 2.md, 3.md).
