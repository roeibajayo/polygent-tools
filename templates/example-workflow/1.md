# Welcome Message

Welcome to this example workflow!

This is a **message step** that provides information to the user. Message steps are useful for:

- Providing instructions
- Explaining the purpose of the workflow
- Giving context before executing tasks

Message steps do not execute any code, they simply display content to the user.
