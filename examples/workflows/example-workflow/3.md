# Clear Agent Context

This is a **clearContext step** that resets the agent's conversation history.

ClearContext steps are useful when:
- Starting a fresh conversation context
- Removing previous conversation history to reduce token usage
- Beginning a new phase of work that doesn't depend on prior context

This step type automatically advances to the next step after execution and doesn't require any content to be executed.
